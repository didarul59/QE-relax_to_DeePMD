2. Copy your Quantum ESPRESSO VC-Relax output file into the `QE_to_DeepMD` folder.  
3. Rename the VC-Relax output file as `opt.out`.  
4. Run the `run.sh` script to process the data.  
5. Modify the `input.json` file inside the `01.train` folder according to your system before training.  
6. Youâ€™re good to go!
